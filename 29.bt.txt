🔹 Problem 2: Unique Permutations With Fixed Positions Blocked
📘 Problem Statement

You are given:

An integer array nums with duplicates

A boolean array blocked of the same length

Generate all unique permutations of nums such that:

If blocked[i] == true, the element at index i cannot be changed

Non-blocked positions can be freely permuted

Return unique permutations only

🔍 Example

Input

nums = [1, 1, 2]
blocked = [true, false, false]


Output

[[1,1,2], [1,2,1]]


Explanation

Index 0 is fixed as 1

Remaining [1,2] are permuted uniquely

🧠 Approach

Keep blocked positions fixed

Backtrack only on free indices

Use a used[] array

Skip duplicates using sorting + pruning
