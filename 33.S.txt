Problem 2 — Count Substrings That Are Palindromes
Problem Statement

Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A substring is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

Two substrings are counted separately if they start or end at different positions.

Examples
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation:
"a","a","a","aa","aa","aaa"

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3

Constraints

1 ≤ s.length ≤ 2000

s consists of lowercase English letters
