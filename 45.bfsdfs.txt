PROBLEM 3: Time-Locked Rooms in a Building

(BFS for unlock times + DFS for reachability)

Problem Statement

You have N rooms connected by corridors (undirected graph).

Each room i unlocks at time unlock[i]

You start at room 0 at time 0

Moving between rooms takes 1 unit time

You may wait inside rooms

Task:

Determine whether you can reach room N-1.

Approach

BFS → compute earliest arrival times

DFS → verify a valid path respecting unlock times
