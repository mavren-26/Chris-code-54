✅ Problem 2 — Count Collisions Using Linear Probing
Problem Statement

You are given N integers and an empty hash table of size M.
Insert the numbers using linear probing and report the total number of collisions that occurred during all insertions.

Definition:

A collision happens when the desired bucket is already occupied, and you move to the next one.

Input

M = 10
Values = [12, 22, 32, 42]


Explanation

12 → index 2 → no collision

22 → index 2 → collision +1

32 → index 2 → collision +2

42 → index 2 → collision +3

Total collisions = 6
