Problem  — Balanced Vowel Window
Problem Statement

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer k.

A substring is called vowel-balanced if in that substring the number of vowels
(a, e, i, o, u) is exactly equal to the number of consonants.

Return the length of the longest substring whose length is at most k and is vowel-balanced.

If no such substring exists, return 0.

Constraints
1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ k ≤ s.length

Examples
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: "leet" → 2 vowels, 2 consonants

Input: s = "abc", k = 2
Output: 0
