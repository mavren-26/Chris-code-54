Problem 1 — Implement Linear Probing Hash Table with Delete Support
Problem Statement

You are given an empty hash table of size N.
You must support three operations using linear probing:

INSERT X → insert integer X into the hash table

SEARCH X → return the index where X is found, otherwise return -1

DELETE X → delete the value X if it exists (mark slot as deleted using a special flag)

Rules:

Collisions must be resolved using linear probing (i.e., try next slot).

If the table is full, ignore the insert.

Deleted slots should be treated as possible positions for new insertions.

Print results for each SEARCH operation.

Input Example

7
INSERT 10
INSERT 20
INSERT 17
SEARCH 17
DELETE 20
SEARCH 20


Output

2
-1
