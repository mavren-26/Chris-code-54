🔹 Problem 2: Combination Sum
Problem Statement

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target,
return all unique combinations where numbers sum to target.

You may reuse the same number unlimited times.

Example
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3], [7]]

Backtracking Idea

Try each number starting from current index

Keep subtracting from target

Stop when target becomes 0 or negative
