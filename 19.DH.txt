Problem 2 — Use a custom Double-Hash set to count distinct integers online

Description.
Given a stream of integers, report the number of distinct values seen so far after each insertion. Implement the set using the double-hashing hash table from Problem 1 (i.e., no builtin set/Map for uniqueness checks).

Input

First line: m q (prime m; q = number of integers)

Next q lines: integer x to insert and then print current distinct count.

Example input

11 5
3
7
3
11
7


Example output

1
2
2
3
3
