PROBLEM 2: Network Infection with Safe Zones

(BFS for infection time + DFS for safe component validation)

Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph with N nodes representing computers.

Some nodes are initially infected

Infection spreads to all neighbors each minute

Some nodes are marked as safe servers

A safe zone is a connected component made entirely of safe servers.

Rules:

If infection reaches any node of a safe zone, the entire zone fails

Otherwise, the safe zone survives

Task:

Return the number of safe zones that fully survive.

💡 Approach

BFS from infected nodes → compute infection time for every node

DFS to explore safe components

If any node in a component has finite infection time → discard zone
