🔹 Problem 1: Generate All Subsets (Power Set)
Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).
The solution must not contain duplicate subsets.

Example
Input: [1, 2]
Output: [[], [1], [2], [1,2]]

Backtracking Idea

At each index, you choose:

include the current element

OR skip it

Recursively build subsets.
