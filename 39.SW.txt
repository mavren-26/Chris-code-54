Problem — Sum of All Nice Subarrays
Problem Statement

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

A subarray is called nice if the sum of its elements is strictly less than k.

Return the total number of nice subarrays.

Constraints
1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5
-10^4 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^4
k can be negative


Note: Array may contain negative numbers — still solve in O(n).

Examples
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: [1], [2], [3], [1,2]

Input: nums = [-1, -1, 2], k = 2
Output: 6
