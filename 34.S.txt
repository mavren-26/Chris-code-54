🧩 Problem 1 — Lexicographically Smallest Single-Cut Rotation
Problem Statement

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.
You are allowed to choose exactly one index i (where 0 ≤ i < len(s)) and rotate the string by moving the substring s[i:] to the front, followed by s[:i].

Formally, the rotated string becomes:

s[i:] + s[:i]


Your task is to return the lexicographically smallest possible string obtainable using exactly one such rotation (including the case i = 0, which leaves the string unchanged).

Constraints

1 ≤ s.length ≤ 2000

s contains only lowercase English letters

Example 1

Input

bca


Output

abc


Explanation
Rotations:

i = 0 → bca

i = 1 → cab

i = 2 → abc ← smallest

Example 2

Input

aaaa


Output

aaaa
